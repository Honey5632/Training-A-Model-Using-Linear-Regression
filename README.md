# Training-A-Model-Using-Linear-Regression

This project focuses on the process of training a Linear Regression model, a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous numerical values. Linear Regression models aim to find the best-fitting linear relationship between a dependent variable (the target we want to predict) and one or more independent variables (features or predictors).

## Core Concepts:
Supervised Learning: Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm, meaning it learns from a dataset that contains both input features and their corresponding correct output labels (the dependent variable).

Linear Relationship: The model assumes that a linear relationship exists between the input features and the target variable. This relationship is represented by a straight line (in simple linear regression with one feature) or a hyperplane (in multiple linear regression with multiple features).

Equation of the Line/Hyperplane: The model seeks to determine the optimal coefficients (weights) for each feature and an intercept (bias) that define this linear relationship. For simple linear regression, this is y = mx + b (or in ML terms, y_predicted = bias + weight * feature). For multiple linear regression, it extends to y_predicted = bias + w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wn*xn.

Loss Function (Mean Squared Error - MSE): To determine the "best-fitting" line, the model uses a loss function to quantify the difference between its predicted values and the actual observed values. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the most common loss function for linear regression, which calculates the average of the squared differences between predictions and actuals. The goal during training is to minimize this loss.

## Optimization (Gradient Descent or Ordinary Least Squares):

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): For simpler cases, a direct mathematical solution (Normal Equation) can be used to calculate the optimal coefficients that minimize MSE.

Gradient Descent: For more complex datasets or when direct solutions are computationally expensive, an iterative optimization algorithm like Gradient Descent is used. It works by incrementally adjusting the model's coefficients in the direction that reduces the loss function, taking small "steps" until it converges to the minimum error.

## Training Process Steps:
Data Collection & Preparation:

Gather relevant data with input features and the target variable.

Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers).

Perform Feature Engineering (if necessary) to create new features or transform existing ones to better capture linear relationships.

## Data Splitting:

Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The model learns from the training data and its performance is evaluated on the unseen testing data to ensure generalization.

## Model Initialization:

Initialize the model's coefficients (weights) and bias, often with small random values.

## Iterative Optimization (for Gradient Descent):

Forward Pass: For each data point in the training set, the model makes a prediction using its current coefficients.

Calculate Loss: The loss function (e.g., MSE) is computed to quantify the prediction error.

Backward Pass (Calculate Gradients): Gradients of the loss function with respect to each coefficient are calculated. These gradients indicate the direction and magnitude of change needed for each coefficient to reduce the loss.

Update Coefficients: The coefficients are adjusted in the opposite direction of their gradients, scaled by a learning rate (a hyperparameter that controls the step size).

Repeat: These steps are repeated over many iterations (epochs) or until the loss converges to a minimum.

## Model Evaluation:

After training, the model's performance is assessed on the unseen test set using metrics like:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared (Coefficient of Determination): Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the dependent variable.

## Libraries Commonly Used:
numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.

pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.

scikit-learn: The go-to library for machine learning in Python, providing easy-to-use implementations of Linear Regression models (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression) and utilities for data splitting (sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split) and evaluation metrics.

matplotlib / seaborn: For data visualization, especially for plotting regression lines and residuals.
